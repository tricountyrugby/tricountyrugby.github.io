title: Welcome to our new site!
---

The Tridents site is finally coming together, hopefully this will make it easier
to communicate with the team and reach out to potential new members. Bookmark the
[News](/news) page and stay tuned for more!

The site has been rewritten using [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com), which will allow team members
and officers to contribute announcements, match reports, and other blog-like content
to the news feed simply by writing plain text.

Expect to see major changes as the site is still in a very incomplete stage.
