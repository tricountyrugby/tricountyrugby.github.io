title: Ireland vs All-Blacks Social
---
As part of [The Rugby Weekend](https://therugbyweekend.com/), Ireland are playing the New Zealand All Blacks in Chicago on November 5th.
To celebrate, we're hosting a social for all those who want to watch the game, eat, drink, and maybe win some cool gear! 

The social will be held at [The Lockport Pub](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lockport+Pub/@43.1534528,-78.6644884,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x64ec09b71370afc1!8m2!3d43.1534528!4d-78.6644884)
starting at 2:00pm, and for $20 at the door you get access to the keg, pizza, and the specials for the night which are $1 domestic beers and
$2 craft beers. We will also be raffling off an authentic Ireland jersey and official All Blacks rugby ball.

This will surely be a night to remember, and the perfect chance to get to know our team and see what rugby is all about. Check out the [Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/144506779344401/)
for any updates, and we hope to see you there!
